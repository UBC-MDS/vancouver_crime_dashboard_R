### Summary

We achieved the dashboard we planned in week one, including three main plots, a card, and a filter panel for DashPy and DashR with a user-friendly interface. Users can filter the crime statistics of Vancouver from 2017 to 2021 by Neighbourhood, Year, and Time of the day.

We created the DashPy and DashR that deliver the exact visualization and functionalities. The only difference is for Crimes by Type (top left bar chart). DashPy displayed the Top 5 crimes for the selected criteria with the legend at the bottom, while DashR displayed all crime types in descending order without a legend but tooltips interactivity. 

Based on the feedback, users enjoyed the interface of the dashboard and the length of data it covers, allowing them to explore the long-term trend of the issue. We also improved our dashboard beyond the original proposal by taking advice from reviewers.
